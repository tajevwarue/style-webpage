        <p>
            To My Beautiful Angel <br>
            I may not be able to carry in my arms now <br>
            As distance separates us <br>
            But I will always carry you in my Heart. <br>
            Whenever your crown gets heavy, <br>
            Remember I'd always be there to help and support you. <br>
            You're braver than you think, <br>
            Stronger than you know, and <br>
            More loved than you can imagine. <br>
            I love to the moon and back. <br>
        </p>
