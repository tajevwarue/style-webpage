        <h1>ROYALTY</h1>
        <p>
            What's better than a bright clear sky? <br>
            The response will differ from different people. <br>
            But when the sky is asked you'd always hear it say: <br> 
                                                                <br>
            A smile from Royalty makes me smile a bright sky. <br> 
            A tear from Royalty makes me rain. <br>
            A word from Royalty makes me sunny and <br>
            A frown from her makes me cloudy. <br>
            At night she's the stars that decorate me. <br> 
            And at dawn the sun that rises from the east. <br>
                                                            <br>
            Please Royalty, smile on through the day as your smile brings joy <br>
            not only to those around but every one on the earth <br>
            as it makes our sky bright and clear. <br>
        </p>
